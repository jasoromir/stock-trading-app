## Description

Given the current hype about GME and cryptocurrencies I decided it was time to learn about the stock market.




## Instructions

  - Install requirements.txt

  - Download Database:
In this project we use SQLite as it is already built into the Python language and is very simpel to configure.
Follow this link to download the [-> SQLite command line executable <-](https://sqlite.org/download.html)

We can create a new database from the command line running the sqlite3 command followed by the name of the database file. If the database file does not exist, a new database will be created. Otherwise SQLite will open the existing database file.

```bash
sqlite3 name-DB.db
```
